# LoanApprovalPrediction

## Description
This study aims to identify key attributes that influence the approval or denial of loan applications and to evaluate the suitability of statistical models for predicting loan outcomes. There are three main stages to the methodology: training models without the protected feature, training models with the protected feature and training models with additional simulated bias. At each stage, evaluation metrics will be calculated to compare performances of the models. Fairness metrics will be implemented to evaluate the presence of bias in different models and across various racial and gender demographics. Overall, the study demonstrated that highly accurate machine learning models can be created using the HMDA dataset to predict loan approvals.
